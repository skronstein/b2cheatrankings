<h1>Driving Tips</h1>

<p>Below about 160mph, holding A without Y will give you the best acceleration, but also causes wheelies a lot. This is the effect of the Super Acceleration cheat.<br>
If you hold A without Y above 160mph, your car will rapidly decelerate to about 160mph.</p>
<p>Above about 160mph, holding A + Y will allow your car to accelerate beyond 160mph. This is the effect of the Disable Speed Restriction cheat.</p>
<p>Holding A + Y will make your car accelerate faster than holding A + Y + R, even though R is gas.</p>
<p>When drifting with a small angle, your car will accelerate faster and have a higher top speed than when than driving in a straight line.</p>
<p>When driving over a bump or hill, or if your car starts to do a wheelie, hold the gas so your car accelerates more slowly. Doing this sometimes prevents your car from losing speed or crashing.</p>


<h1>What are Race Crash Total and Big Crash?</h1>

<p>Both of these categories only apply to Single Races.</p>
<p>Race Crash Total is the total amount of damage done to traffic during the race.</p>
<p>Big Crash is the largest amount of damage from an individual crash during the race.</p>


<h1>Best cars for use with super acceleration:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Oval Racer: Very good acceleration, even when the needle goes big. Best car for most tracks, especially ones with long straight areas. Easier to control and harder to flip than the Japanese Muscle</li>
<li>Japanese Muscle: Best for tight tracks. Average acceleration. Sometimes flips when accelerating over bumps such as sidewalks. Top speed I've attained so far with turbostart was 472mph.</li>
<li>Gangster: Best acceleration of any car when using Disable Speed Restriction, especially past 350mph. top speed at least 467mph without turbostart and 500mph with turbostart. However, tires have less grip than most other cars.</li>
<li>Hotrod: Excellent acceleration, almost as fast as the Gangster. hard to flip over, even when accelerating over bumps. I did 698mph with turbostart on Big Surf Grove.</li>
<li>Custom Coupe: Average acceleration. When going over bumps at high speeds, the car sinks into the ground more than other cars do, so you spend less time in the air, which means you can start accelerating again sooner after the jump. This is most noticeable on some parts of Big Surf Shores, and on the bumps near the beginning of 88 Interchange. The highest speed I've attained with turbstart was 442mph.</li>
</ul>
