<h1>Driving Tips</h1>

<p>Below about 160mph, holding A without Y will give you the best acceleration. This is the effect of the Super Acceleration cheat.</p>
<p>Above about 160mph, holding A + Y will allow your car to accelerate beyond 160mph. This is the effect of the Disable Speed Restriction cheat.</p>
<p>When drifting with a small angle, your car will have better acceleration and top speed than when than driving in a straight line.</p>
<p>If your car starts to do a wheelie (usually when driving over a bump or hill), hold R (gas). This usually prevents your car from crashing or losing speed/control due to catching air.</p>


<h1>What are Race Crash Total and Big Crash?</h1>

<p>Both of these categories only apply to Single Races.</p>
<p>Race Crash Total is the total amount of damage done to traffic during the race.</p>
<p>Big Crash is the largest amount of damage from an individual crash during the race.</p>


<h1>Best cars for use with Super Acceleration and Disable Speed Restriction:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Oval Racer: Very good acceleration. Best car for most tracks, especially ones with long straight areas. Easier to control and harder to flip than the Japanese Muscle.</li>
<li>Japanese Muscle: Best for tracks with many tight curves, like Sunrise Valley. Average acceleration. Sometimes flips when accelerating over bumps such as sidewalks.</li>
<li>Gangster: Best acceleration of any car when using Disable Speed Restriction, especially past 350mph. However, tires have less grip than most other cars.</li>
<li>Hotrod: Excellent acceleration, almost as fast as the Gangster. Hard to flip over, even when accelerating over bumps.</li>
<li>Custom Coupe: Average acceleration. When going over bumps at high speeds, the car sinks into the ground more than other cars do, so you spend less time in the air, which means you can start accelerating again sooner after the jump. This is most noticeable on some parts of Big Surf Shores, and on the bumps near the beginning of 88 Interchange.</li>
</ul>
